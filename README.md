## About  
The primary purpose of Skill Swaps is to facilitate a centralized, community-driven platform for users to exchange knowledge and skills without monetary transactions. It allows us to learn new skills from each other and while simultaneously still giving back. It offers users who can help each other to exchange personal details to fulfill their goals.
